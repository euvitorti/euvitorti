# About Me

I am a developer focused on becoming a backend specialist with Java. I have practical experience in personal and academic projects, where I used Java and Spring Boot to create REST APIs and work with databases like MySQL. Additionally, I apply agile methodologies such as Kanban to optimize development.

I am currently in my third semester of the Systems Development course at SENAI and supplement my education with courses at Alura and FIAP, always seeking to enhance my skills and be prepared for new challenges.
